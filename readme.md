## Project Title

  Uncertainty  Quantification Based on Conformal Prediction for Industrial Time Series  with Distribution Shift  

## Description

This project implements an uncertainty quantification framework for time series prediction in industrial processes, addressing the challenge of temporal dependencies and distribution drift. By integrating conformal prediction (CP) with both entire and local nonconformity scores, this approach dynamically adjusts the confidence levels of prediction intervals over time. The framework adapts more quickly to distribution shifts and produces more efficient prediction intervals compared to traditional methods.
